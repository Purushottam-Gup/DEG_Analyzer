## 🚀 **Key Features**

* ✅ **Upload Data Easily**: Accepts expression data in common formats (CSV, TSV, Excel)
* 📊 **DEG Identification**: Uses robust statistical methods (e.g., limma, DESeq2-like analysis) to identify significantly up- or down-regulated genes
* 📈 **Visualization Tools**: Automatically generates:

  * Volcano plots
  * Heatmaps
  * MA plots
  * Boxplots
* 🧪 **Flexible Filters**: Adjust p-value, log2 fold change, and FDR thresholds
* 🔍 **Gene Search**: Instantly find and highlight genes of interest
* 💾 **Export Results**: Download filtered DEG tables and high-quality plots
* 🧠 **Gene Annotation Support**: Map gene symbols to biological information (GO terms, pathways, etc.) using integrated databases (optional)
